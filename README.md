# Diabetes-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning
This project aims to build and optimize machine learning models to predict the presence of diabetes in patients based on medical diagnostic features. In addition to standard model development, we also explored misclassified samples (False Positives and False Negatives) to extract hidden patterns and improve the overall performance of the final model.

## Dataset

We used the [Pima Indians Diabetes Database](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database), which contains medical data for female patients of at least 21 years old.

**Features include:**

- Pregnancies
- Glucose
- Blood Pressure
- Skin Thickness
- Insulin
- BMI
- Diabetes Pedigree Function
- Age
- Outcome (0: Non-Diabetic, 1: Diabetic)
